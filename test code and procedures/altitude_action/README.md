This is a sketch for testing functionality based on altitude derived from the GPS module. 

The hardware for this test consists of a single servo motor attached to a pin.  This pin his holding together linkage that connects a payload (anything) to the bottom of Boba Fettuccine.
At a predetermined height above the starting altitude (altitude measurement when GPS module boots), the servo actuates and releases the payload.
